# XRP Ledger Challenge
# Evolving Finance with blockchain

Case Introduction:

XRP Ledger addresses the need for accessible platform for the  issuance and management of digital assets.

Utilize XRPL and/or its new EVM Sidechain to develop a finance app. The app may encompass decentralized finance (DeFi), such as decentralized exchanges, lending, etc., or focus on enhancing payment systems with solutions for cross-border transactions, micropayments, tokenized payments, and digital wallets. Additionally, the solution may explore areas such as insurance technology (InsurTech), regulatory technology (RegTech), asset management, financial inclusion, personal finance tools, supply chain finance, crowdfunding, digital identity, sustainable finance, and risk management within the app

What is the current problem?
* The world of finance needs more speed, accessibility and reliability . The objective of the challenge is to rethink financial services leveraging XRP Ledger

Who are the users of this solution?
* Open to all audiences and up to the project to decide

## Expected Outcome:
Prototype enabling financial transactions using XRP Leder or the EVM Sidechain

## What we created:
During the last 48 hours we worked on the topic of Rental Deposit Contracts on the XRPL EVM Sidechain Testnet. The prototype can be deployed to any EVM-compatible blockchain. The dApp allows to interact with the Smart Contract in the role as tenant and landlord. Additionally we created screens of a possible UI (webapp) in Figma.

TENANT MOVES IN
1. Landlord deploys contract by entering the public key of the tenant and defining how much the rental deposit has to be
2. Tenant connects his wallet to the dApp and deposits the required amount
3. Landlord can verify the status of the deposit through the dApp

TENANT MOVES OUT
1. Landlord enters the shares for the payout
2. Tenant signs the contract as well if he agrees
3. Contract pays out the amounts accoriding to the shares back to the landlord and tenant
